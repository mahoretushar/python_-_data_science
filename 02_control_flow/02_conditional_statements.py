# In almost every program there are times we need to make decisions and that's when we use 'if' statement
# Following is an example

smartphone_price = 26000

if smartphone_price < 25000:
    print("go ahead and place the order")
elif smartphone_price > 30000:
    print("do not place the order")
else:
    print("enjoy window shopping")

print("Done")
